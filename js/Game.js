//What should be objects? 

//The game pieces, red vs. yellow as separate objects
//The user interacts by moving them with arrows and dropping them in a column
//Their position on the x axis will change one unit based on user input, left vs. right
//Should the playing table be an object?
//When player hits enter, the current piece falls to the bottom of the grid (Y position of 0)
//Then automatically switches color to next turn?
//If this were React, state would be the position and color of the current piece

//Winning: Could we number each circle on the grid and use conditionals to determine winner? T/F for if there is a row with the same color?
//Not sure how I would do that.

//CLASSES: GAME, PLAYER, BOARD, SPACES, TOKEN
